White threatens to trade off Black\'s c6-knight, leaving the e5-pawn undefended. It\'s not an immediate threat, because after 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. Nxe5, Black can win the pawn back with 5... Qd4 or 5... Qg5. Black can respond in a variety of ways. The most common move is the Morphy Defence 3... a6. This forces White to make a decision about the Bishop - retreat or exchange. Many other moves are available, some neglecting completely the protection of the knight and the pawn and continuing development. The opening is named after the 16th century Spanish priest Ruy LÃ³pez de Segura.', category_id = 1, views = 0, favorites = 0, supplies_text = None, supplies_image = None)
