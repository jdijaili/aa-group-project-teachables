Of course, this is technically not random as reliably producing the same result from the same initial condition is actually a deterministic behavior, but because of the practical unpredictability desired for this system, we'll continue to refer to them as \"random numbers\".\n\nAnother key difference is that game random number generation rarely requires the generation process to take time as cryptography does to mitigate brute force attacks; because random number generation is used to determine the results of events in the game, resolving those results quickly can prevent hold-ups in gameplay.",
