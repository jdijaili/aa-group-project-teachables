To address this, I split the result into several string segments, then joined them back together after interpreting them into the desired encoding base.\n\nThe second issue was more of a self-imposed constraint. In order to mitigate some of the bias in reading the table with arbitrary ranges, I decided I wanted to encode the random number table in base 12 because it was a local high point for divisibility with other numbers.

Interpreting the slice of the table into base 10 then allows it to be returned. Finally, incrementing the stored index moves the table along.\n\nIn the situation where the number of outcomes is not a power of the encoding base, it should be noted that it's impossible to completely eliminate bias.

But instead of removing the stitches from your knitting needle, remove the darning needle and leave the \"line\" in and continue working normally. If you make a mistake you can't easily fix, rip out back to the lifeline which will nicely hold your stitches for you while you put them back on the knitting needle.
