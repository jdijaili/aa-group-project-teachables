This resulted in the last several digits on the table always being set to 0. To address this, I split the result into several string segments, then joined them back together after interpreting them into the desired encoding base.\n\nThe second issue was more of a self-imposed constraint. In order to mitigate some of the bias in reading the table with arbitrary ranges, I decided I wanted to encode the random number table in base 12 because it was a local high point for divisibility with other numbers. This meant converting from sha256's base 64 results into base 10, which could then be converted into base 12 since JavaScripts base conversion isn't arbitrary.", image="images/project-rnTable/table-code.png"))

Interpreting the slice of the table into base 10 then allows it to be returned. Finally, incrementing the stored index moves the table along.\n\nIn the situation where the number of outcomes is not a power of the encoding base, it should be noted that it's impossible to completely eliminate bias. This approach of dividing the remainder into fractional parts in the remainder naturally separates the clumps of results. Compared to the results clumping at the lower values by using modulo, this method obfuscates the location of the bias slightly.", image="images/project-range/range-code.png"))

Notably, a non-random select will require setting what the selection will be somewhere, and in an implementation that uses non-random selection more frequently, an additional argument (or not using the factory pattern at all) may be better. Finally, it should be noted that having a default (or non-conditional else statement) allows for catching unexpected situations (such as a misspelled type) while not halting program flow.", image="images/project-rooms/rooms-code.png"))
