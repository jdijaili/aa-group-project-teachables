# Teachables
This [student project](https://aa-group-project-teachables.herokuapp.com/) is a clone of [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/), an app that allows users to post sets of instructions for building things. The project was made by [Ryan Bender](https://github.com/ryanbender34), [Jennifer Dijaili](https://github.com/jdijaili), [Yu Ra Kim](https://github.com/kim-yura), and [Nathaniel Tseng](https://github.com/ntseng) from February 7th 2022 to February 11th 2022.

Students were encouraged to plan during the week of January 31st 2022 to February 4th 2022, but were not given starting materials until the 4th.
